The user prepares, and edits from the Radiogram tab:

<br>

The CK value will be computed for you when the data is saved or a text
document created for printing or transmission.  You can also force a
CK by pressing the "ck" button.

ARL message creation is aided by a dialog which is exposed when the
ARL MSG button is pressed

</center>
<br>


The number of "fill" edit entries will vary with the requirement of the
selected ARL message.  Multiple ARL messages may be inserted into the Message
text.

Pressing the Check button on the maint Radiogram tab will force all of the
fields to be tested for correctness.  The Message text will be converted to
upper case, the leading and trailing spaces and end-of-line characters
removed.  Periods and commas will be converted to the stop character
character, 'X', unless they are an integral part of a word, such as
NBEMS.files.  The precedence and handling fields are fixed to the selector
values.  You may optionally elect to insert X between each field.  This
might help to increase readability of long fields with multiple words.

The records tab contains data relevant to the transmission and receipt
of the message:

The two principal output files are
<a href="aux/radiogram_doc.html">html view document</a>,
and <a href="aux/radiogram.txt">ascii text document</a>. The ascii text
document is correctly formatted for CW or voice transmission.
